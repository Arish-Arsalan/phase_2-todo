# Phase 5: Advanced Cloud Deployment with Kafka/Dapr

## Objective
Implement advanced features and deploy to production-grade Kubernetes with Kafka and Dapr integration.

## Requirements
- [ ] Advanced features: Recurring tasks, due dates & reminders
- [ ] Intermediate features: Priorities, tags, search, filter, sort
- [ ] Event-driven architecture with Kafka
- [ ] Dapr for distributed application runtime
- [ ] Deploy to cloud Kubernetes (AKS/GKE)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging

## Architecture
- Kafka for event streaming and decoupling services
- Dapr for building block abstractions
- Cloud Kubernetes for production deployment
- Advanced task management features
- Event-driven microservices architecture

## Success Criteria
- All advanced features implemented and functional
- Kafka-based event streaming operational
- Dapr building blocks properly configured
- Cloud deployment successful and stable
- CI/CD pipeline automates deployments
- Monitoring provides actionable insights
