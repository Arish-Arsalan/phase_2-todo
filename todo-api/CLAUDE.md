# Claude Code Instructions for Todo Application

## Project Overview
This is a spec-driven, AI-generated Todo Application built for the AIDD Hackathon, demonstrating progressive complexity through 5 phases.

## Phases Implemented
- **Phase 1**: Console application with Rich UI
- **Phase 2**: Foundation API & Monorepo skeleton (FastAPI + Next.js)
- **Phase 3**: AI Chatbot with MCP integration
- **Phase 4**: Local Kubernetes deployment with Helm
- **Phase 5**: Advanced cloud deployment with Kafka/Dapr

## Architecture Guidelines
- Follow the existing monorepo structure
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- Use FastAPI for backend APIs
- Use Next.js for frontend
- Implement MCP tools for AI integration
- Use Dapr for distributed application runtime
- Follow cloud-native deployment patterns

## Development Workflow
1. Always refer to the specifications in `specs/feat/`
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Follow established coding patterns
4. Update documentation accordingly
5. Test thoroughly before committing

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.13+
- FastAPI
- Next.js
- Docker & Docker Compose
